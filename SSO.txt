Objectives
1.	Develop and implement a secure SSO solution that allows users to authenticate once and access all connected applications.
2.	Integrate the SSO solution across Sconnect App, mappls, Maruti, and prepare the architecture for future application integration.
3.	Enhance security through proper token management, encryption, and adherence to industry best practices.
4.	Minimize user inconvenience by eliminating the need for repetitive logins across applications.
5.	Enable scalability to accommodate future applications within our ecosystem.

Implementation
We can implement this feature in two ways. 
•	Fully Customized by us.
•	Use the Firebase authentication.

Fully Customized Approach:
Implementation Steps
1.	SSO System Design:
•	Design the SSO system architecture, token management, and authentication flows.
•	Determine the authentication protocols, such as OAuth 2.0, to be used for seamless user verification.
2.	Backend Development:
•	Develop the backend infrastructure to handle authentication requests, token generation, validation, and storage.
•	Implement APIs for communication between the applications and the SSO system.
3.	Frontend Integration:
•	Integrate the SSO authentication flow seamlessly into the user interface of each connected application.
•	Develop user interfaces for login, registration, and error handling.
4.	Security Measures:
•	Implement strong encryption for token transmission and storage to ensure data security.
•	Set up token expiration and renewal mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

Firebase Approach
Firebase Authentication with an existing account system is a common scenario when you want to provide additional authentication options or simplify the authentication process for your users. Firebase Authentication offers various authentication methods like email/password, Google Sign-In, Facebook Login, Apple Sign-In, and more. By integrating Firebase Authentication, you can enhance security, provide a seamless user experience, and reduce the maintenance overhead of managing your own authentication system.
Here's a general guide on how to integrate Firebase Authentication with your existing account system:
1.	Set Up Firebase Project:
•	Create a new Firebase project or use an existing one.
•	Go to the Firebase Console and set up Firebase Authentication.
2.	Choose Authentication Methods:
•	Decide which authentication methods you want to support using Firebase Authentication. For example, you might want to support email/password, Google Sign-In, and Apple Sign-In.
3.	Migrate User Data:
•	If you have existing user accounts in your own system, you'll need to migrate user data to Firebase Authentication. This could involve exporting user information and importing it into Firebase.
4.	Integrate Firebase SDK:
•	Integrate the Firebase SDK into your existing applications. This might involve adding Firebase libraries and configuring the SDK with your Firebase project credentials.
5.	Implement Authentication Flows:
•	Depending on the authentication methods you're using, implement the necessary authentication flows using Firebase SDK functions. For example:
•	For email/password authentication, use createUserWithEmailAndPassword and signInWithEmailAndPassword.
•	For Google Sign-In, use FirebaseUI or implement custom code with GoogleAuthProvider.
•	For other methods, follow Firebase's documentation for each specific authentication provider.
6.	User Management:
•	Use Firebase Authentication's user management features to handle user profiles, password resets, email verification, etc.
7.	SSO and Account Linking (Optional):
•	If you want to provide a seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) experience, you can implement account linking. This allows users with existing accounts to link their Firebase-authenticated account with their existing account.


Results and Benefits
•	Users experience enhanced convenience by needing to log in only once to access multiple applications.
•	Reduced friction leads to increased user engagement and satisfaction.
•	The SSO solution strengthens security through robust authentication and token management practices.
•	Future application integration becomes smoother, as the architecture is designed to accommodate new apps.
•	Our ecosystem gains a competitive edge by offering a unified user experience.
Conclusion
The successful implementation of the Single Sign-On solution serves as a significant step toward unifying our applications under a seamless authentication umbrella. By reducing user effort and enhancing security, we pave the way for a more engaging and integrated user experience across our entire ecosystem.
